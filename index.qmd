## Ann Johnston

I'm currently a PhD student in the [department of statistics]() at [Penn State University](), advised by [Dr. Aleksandra SlavkoviÄ‡](). 

My research interests lie in algebraic statisics and official statistics, with a special focus on understanding and predicting population estimates under missing/incomplete data.

Prior to joining Penn State, I got my Masters' degree in Mathematics from the [University of Southern California](), and did my undergrad in Mathematics at [Harvey Mudd College]().
