## Ann Johnston

I'm currently a PhD student in the [department of statistics](https://science.psu.edu/stat) at [Penn State University](https://psu.edu), advised by [Dr. Aleksandra SlavkoviÄ‡](https://sites.psu.edu/sesa/). 

My research interests lie in algebraic statisics and official statistics, with a special focus on understanding and predicting population estimates under missing/incomplete data.

Prior to joining Penn State, I got my Masters' degree in Mathematics from the [University of Southern California](https://dornsife.usc.edu/mathematics/), and did my undergrad in Mathematics at [Harvey Mudd College](https://www.hmc.edu/mathematics/).
